This directory contains 4 files:

- dump.sql
  A dump file which can be used to create a MySQL clone of the database used for 
  the databasemanagement course. 

- dump-sqlite-compatible.sql
  A dump file which can be used to create a SQLite clone of the database used 
  for the databasemanagement course. To create this database, all non compatible
  code from the MySQL dump file was deleted, which means that it misses some
  functionalities. 

- examples.sql
  Some SQL examples. All examples should work in MySQL. All examples exept for 
  RIGHT INNER JOIN should work in sqlite as well. LEFT INNER JOIN should work
  in SQLite as well. The examples in the book with FULL OUTER JOIN functions 
  don't work in MySQL and SQLite.

- practice_db.sqlite3
  A ready to use SQLite database. Just run the command 'sqlite3 practice_db.sqlite3'
  to use it. Just use a few queries from examples.sql to test it.
